# Calories! Count em.
Calorie counter app created in vanilla JS.
My focus with this project was to refresh my JS memory. The CSS is very messy and poor. I just wanted to prototype this app for myself.

## Features:
- ✔️ Keeps track of consumed calories!
- ☁️ Displays temperature based on geolocation!
- 🏃‍♂️ Add burned calories to deduct from your total consumed!
- ✨ Simple design allows for easy calorie counting without the fuss!
- 💭 Stores database on client for fast access!
